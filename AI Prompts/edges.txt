Ok now let's talk about edges now. In the later stages (stage 3) we will define edges between nodes (nodes will be defined in stage 2, except for entry nodes which we will define in stage 1). main line edges will be defined between entry node of a station to entry node of another station. Station entry edges will be defined from station entry node to all of it's track nodes on the same saide (if station entry is east, then 2 edges per track node on east side of that stations will be designed. one for each direction. One edge from entry to track_this will be track entry edge, one edge from track node to entry node this will serve as track exit edge), 2 edges per platform will be defined between it's east and west track nodes (2 edges between track 1's east and west nodes, 2 edges between track 2's east and west nodes etc. 1 from east node to west node, the other one in opposite direction from west to east node for every platform). In stage 4 we will define connections (u-turns). Every track node will serve as U-turn points. So let's assume a vehicle enters Station b's track 3 from east side end it stops as intermediate stop on it's route, it uses edge_track_B_3_east_to_west. If it's route forces it to leave the station from east side (this is where this vehicle already entered the station) it can not do it from the same edge that it enters the station. But we defined 2 edges between eact track's nodes. So there is another edge it can use edge_B_track_3_west_to_east. So at node node_B_track_3_west define a u turn connection from edge edge_track_B_3_east_to_west to edge edge_B_track_3_west_to_east. It is the same for it's east track node. That means each trock node allows vehicles to make u-turn and switch to the track edge of the same track on the opposite direction.  Is that clear?
